# example.BarCalculator
A program used to keep track of open tabs at a bar

# TO-DO
- Currently in the process of migrating to web application
- Goal should be an aesthetically pleasing, easy to use web app
- Add support for drinks of the same name, but different price/size. If this were to occur, add the prices and sizes together and calculate price per drink from total
- Display price per drink when user is ordering
- Add support for removing a drink from a person, removing a person from the tab, and removing a drink from the menu

# Future Features
- Add support for relational database to save data after app is closed 
- Allow users to have 'connect' to bar through code, where they can sign in to their profile and "order" their own drinks from their own device
